# Perfect Maze Generator

My Web Maze generates perfect mazes with a hand-drawn aesthetic. Users can customize dimensions, solve mazes by tracing paths, and download their creations in various formats. Features include adjustable cell sizes, hard mode with limited visibility, and performance tracking with a timer and star rating system.

## How to Use

1. **Generate a Maze**: Enter a seed number or click the reload button to create a new random maze
2. **Adjust Cell Size**: Use your mouse wheel (on computer) or pinch gesture (on phone) to make cells larger or smaller
3. **Resize the Maze**: Drag the bottom-right corner to change dimensions
4. **Trace the Path**: Click and drag to trace the path from entrance to exit 
5. **Hard Mode**: Toggle "Hard Mode" to only see part of the maze while solving for an extra challenge
6. **Track Performance**: Use the timer and star rating system to measure your solving skills
7. **Download**: Save your maze as an SVG or PNG file using the download buttons
8. **Multiple Mazes**: Create a PDF with multiple mazes on a single page using the "Multiple Mazes" button
9. **Reset Path**: Clear your traced path with the reset button to try again
10. **Share Mazes**: Bookmark or share the URL of any maze - the seed number in the URL (e.g., #12345) creates the exact same maze every time

## Implementation

The maze is generated using a combination of advanced algorithms:

- **Enhanced Depth-First Search**: The core algorithm uses a modified DFS with directional persistence to create more natural flow patterns.
- **Strategic Wall Removal**: Selectively removes walls to create loops while maintaining puzzle integrity and difficulty.
- **Optimization Engine**: A multi-generation system that creates multiple candidate mazes with varying parameters and selects the most challenging one.
- **Difficulty Scoring**: Analyzes maze complexity using factors including branch points, false paths, solution length, and decision point density.

The maze generation system ensures:
- Balanced complexity with customizable difficulty levels
- Variable dead-end length for more engaging puzzles
- High-quality mazes that provide appropriate challenge for solvers
- Proper entrance and exit placement with guaranteed solution path
